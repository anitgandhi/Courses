Background - Employers and fellow students wanted a way to find students with certain skills. This skillset database allows for people to put in their information, and for others to search for it.

Information form for UIUC students to put in their information. Coded in HTML - http://ieee.illinois.edu/skillset-database/
The submit button links to the insert page, coded in PHP ("Skillset Database Insert.php") to insert into the MySQL database - http://ieee.illinois.edu/skillset-insert/

The retrieve form allows people to search for other people by querying the database, coded in HTML - http://ieee.illinois.edu/skillset-search/
This goes to the results page, which is coded in PHP ("Skillset Database Retrieve.php") - http://ieee.illinois.edu/skillset-results/
