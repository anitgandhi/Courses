This folder contains a few random Python scripts I made for my Cryptology class I took during my semester abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

Here's the context/problem statement for the scripts:
	- Vigenere.py : We were given a ciphertext encrypted using the Vigenere cipher. We had to find the length of the key using the index of coincidence and frequency analysis, then find the key, and finally get the plaintext.
	- numPrimes.py : Find the number of primes in a given range based on the Miller-Rabin primality test
	- factor.py : Prove that the two primes whose product is the RSA modulus should not have a small difference by factoring a given number
	- ElGamal.py : ElGamal Digital Signature system
